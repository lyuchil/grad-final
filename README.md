# Final Project - Militray Spending Timeline

## By: Luke Foley, Nichloas Heineman, Yu-Chi Liang

In this project, we created a military spending timeline for different countires based on specific events. We analyzed the data set and notice that the military spending is not linear. There are multiple different factors that can impact a change in spending. We used this project to study and analyze what types of events cause drastic change and how different countries respond. This project also served as a way for us to practice different visualization techniques.
